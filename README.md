# **Item Frame Protector**
### A small bit of code to stop projectiles breaking item frames in sponge.

## DISCLAIMER
It is currently not very tested, nor extensible. It is intended to be a quick short term fix while other fixes are found. You can see the code, it's not a virus, just don't shout at me if it doesn't work when SpongeAPI changes etc. Although, that in mind, if you are using this, and it does no longer work, please get into contact and I can see if I can fix it.
